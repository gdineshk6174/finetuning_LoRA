# Fine-Tuning a GPT Model with PEFT and LoRA  

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a **decoder-style GPT model** using **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** called **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**.  
The model used for fine-tuning is **BigScience/BLOOM-7B1**, and the dataset consists of **English quotes from Abirate/english_quotes**.  
The guide covers the fundamentals of **LoRA fine-tuning** and how to upload the trained model to **Hugging Face Hub** for easy sharing and deployment.  

## üîç What is Fine-Tuning?  
Fine-tuning is the process of taking a **pre-trained** language model and further training it on a **specific dataset** to adapt its responses to a particular domain or task.  
Instead of training a model from scratch (which requires enormous data and computation), fine-tuning **refines an already capable model** to enhance its performance for specialized tasks such as **summarization, chatbots, and text classification**.  

## üîß What is PEFT?  
**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** is a technique that fine-tunes **only a small subset** of a model‚Äôs parameters instead of the entire model.  
This significantly **reduces computational cost and memory usage**, making fine-tuning large models feasible on consumer hardware.  
PEFT allows modifications without drastically changing the base model, enabling efficient adaptation while preserving the model's general knowledge.  

## ‚ö° What is LoRA?  
**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** is a popular **PEFT** method that **injects lightweight trainable layers** into a pre-trained model, allowing it to learn task-specific adjustments without modifying the original parameters.  
LoRA **reduces GPU memory requirements** by **freezing the main model weights** and adding low-rank matrices to selected layers, making fine-tuning scalable and efficient.
